# Universal Interface Model

The universal interface model (UIM) delivers the foundation for describing interfaces and behavior across all viewpoints. As such, as SPES ML modeler, you will never explicitely instantiate elements of the UIM, as you will instead create elements of the functional, logical and technical viewpoints. However, as the UIM is the basis for all interfaces in each viewpoint, you will implicitely use the UIM all the time. The following section describe the concepts of the UIM and how they map to SPES ML model elements of the different viewpoints.
