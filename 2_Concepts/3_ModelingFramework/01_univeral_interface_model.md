# Universal Interface Model

The universal interface model (UIM) delivers the foundation for describing interfaces and behavior across all viewpoints. As such, as SPES ML modeler, you will never explicitely instantiate elements of the UIM, as you will instead create elements of the functional, logical and technical viewpoints. However, as the UIM is the basis for all interfaces in each viewpoint, you will implicitely use the UIM all the time. The following section describe the concepts of the UIM and how they map to SPES ML model elements of the different viewpoints.

## General Concepts
### System Elements

A system element models the behaviors of (a part of) a system. Each system element consists of a syntactic and a semantic interface. An example for a system element in the logical viewpoint is a logical component.

The *syntactic interface* describes the system element's input and output channels where each channel is a typed communication link between system elements.
In the context of the communication between system elements, the instances of the data types are called *messages*. 
For example, the instance ```5``` of the data type ```int``` is said to be a message when it is communicated over a channel.
Only messages of a channel's data type may be communicated via the channel.

A system element is called *atomic* if it has no subelements. Otherwise, it is called *composed*.
Atomic system elements are not further composed and directly have behavior descriptions linked to them (e.g. state machine models). 
The following figure depicts the relation between system elements, channels, and data types.

System elements interact via sending and receiving typed messages via their input and output channels.
The *semantic interface* defines the behavior of the system element by relating streams of messages received by the system element on its input channels to the
streams of messages emitted by the system element via its output channels. 
As described in the following, the semantic interface of an atomic system element can, inter alia, be defined by a state machine. The semantic interface of a composed system element is always defined by the composition of the semantic interfaces of its subelements.
