### Technical Viewpoint
#### Technical Component Modeling (TCM)                                    
##### TCM A: For technical components, their interface is modeled with associated input and output  signals.
##### TCM B: The behavior of the technical components is modeled.                                                                                                                          
##### TCM C: technical components and requirements they satisfy are related by a satisfy or require  relation.                                                                                                     
#### Technical Architecture Modeling (TAM)                                 
##### TAM A: The technical components and their dependencies are modeled.
##### TAM B: Technical components are related to logical components that they implement by a realize relation.           
#### Technical conText Modelling (TTM)                                
##### TTM A: The   system under development (i.e., the top-level technical component) is modeled by a composition of all technical components.

##### TTM B: Actors  of the operational context (e.g., external systems or users) are modeled with   a syntactic interface (inputs and outputs). 

##### TTM C: For  each actor in the operational context, the behavior is modeled.
