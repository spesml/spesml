# Approach usage

## How to use the SpesML MM
The usage of the SpesML MM is similar to the MBSE MM.

**T1: Assess current processes**
Equipped with the SpesML MM, the organization should compare its current MBSE development processes with the capabilities described in the maturity matrix. Engineers should question whether they produce similar artifacts for each capability in the matrix. For instance, the capability RES A mandates some attributes to be identified, and it could be the case that the organization does identify some attributes but not all described in this capability. This capability then is marked as TO BE ADAPTED. If the organization does not do anything similar to what is described in the capability, it should be marked as UNIMPLEMENTED.

**A1: Current processes similar to SpesML MM capabilities**
This artifact is a list of capabilities from the SpesML MM that are similar to the current development activities the organization already employs. With this information, the organization can know which activities need to be fitted to the SpesML MF and which capabilities need to be adopted anew. 

**T2: Identify implementation goal**
At this task, the organization should think about its modeling needs, considering how its development unit is located within the development life cycle. This is the case if a full implementation of the SpesML Modeling Framework is intended. 

**A2: Implementation goal**
This artifact is produced in task T2 and lists all capabilities that the organization should have in place to achieve its implementation goal.

**T3: Adapt current processes**
The current processes identified as similar to the SpesML capabilities must be adapted to how the modeling framework prescribes them. These processes are identified in task T1 and are described in artifact A1.

**T4: Adopt missing capabilities**
In this task, capabilities not identified as similar in task T1 must be adopted considering the implementation goal described by artifact A2.
