# Approach usage

## How to use the SpesML MM
The usage of the SpesML MM is similar to the MBSE MM.

**T1: Assess current processes**
Equipped with the SpesML MM, the organization should compare their current MBSE development processes with the capabilities described in the maturity matrix. For each capability in the matrix, engineers should question whether they produce similar artifacts. For instance, the capability RES A mandates some attributes to be identified and could be the case that the organization does identify some attributes but not all of the ones described in this capability. This capability then is marked as TO BE ADAPTED. If the organization does not do anything similar to what is described in the capability then it should be marked as UNIMPLEMENTED.

**A1: Current processes similar to SpesML MM capabilites**
This artifact is a list of capabilities from the SpesML MM that are similar to the current development activities the organization already employs. With this information, the organization can know which activities need to be fitted to the SpesML MF and which capabilities need to be adopted anew. 

**T2: Identify implementation goal**
At this task, the organization should think about their modeling needs, which should to take into consideration how their development unit is located within the whole development life cycle. This is the case if a full implementation of the SpesML Modeling Framework is intended or not. 

**A2: Implementation goal**
This artifact is produced in task T2 and lists all capabilities that the organization should have in place in order to achieve its implementation goal.

**T3: Adapt current processes**
The current processes that were identified as similar to the SpesML capabilities must be adapted to how is prescribed by the modeling framework. These processes are identified in task T1 and are described in artifact A1.

**T4: Adopt missing capabilities**
In this task, capabilities that were not identified as similar in task T1 must be adopted taking into consideration the implementation goal as described by artifact A2.
