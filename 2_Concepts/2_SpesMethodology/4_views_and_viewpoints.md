# Views and Viewpoints

In the engineering process of a software-intensive embedded system multiple stakeholders with different concerns are involved. The concept of viewpoints aims at separating the different concerns of stakeholders during the engineering process and serves as a construct for managing the different artifacts during the engineering process.

The IEEE Standard 1471 characterizes viewpoints as a specification of the conventions for constructing and using a view. In other words, a viewpoint is a pattern or template that can be used to develop individual views on a system (and its environment). Typically, the specification of a viewpoint defines that viewpoint in terms of its syntax, semantics and pragmatics by providing, among others, the name of the viewpoint, the corresponding stakeholder concerns, the viewpoint language, and techniques which can be used during the construction and analysis of the corresponding view.

Given a viewpoint specification, a view can be characterized as a concrete model of the system that represents the information that is relevant for the corresponding viewpoint concerns by using the conceptual structure of the underlying viewpoint language.
