# SpesML License Model

SpesML is a modeling workbench for efficient model-based development of embedded systems which supports the SPES methodology including the underlying FOCUS semantics based on the modeling language SysML. Moreover, a tool implementation based on MagicDraw is provided which supports the methodology consistently and semantically correctly and offers advanced analysis options.

The artifacts (models, code, documentation) generated in the SpesML project are published under three levels of licenses.

## License Overview

The SpesML workbench has different licenses for the following three classes of artifacts:

* (Class 1) SpesML work bench related artifacts: These are the artifacts finally generated/produced by the SpesML work bench

* (Class 2) Magic Draw Plugins: Java library for MagicDraw constituting the SpesML workbench tool implementation

* (Class 3) SpesML Documentation for SpesML concepts and plugins, models of running example

Each class has its own license:

* (Class 1) SpesML workbench related artifacts: The artifacts produced with the help of the SpesML workbench can be freely used also for commercial use.

* (Class 2) Magic Draw Plugin: The SpesML Plugin Library components are published in GitHub under the BSD-3-Clause license.

* (Class 3) SpesML Documentation: The documentation for the SpesML-WB (description of concepts, the plugin documentation and the artifacts of the SpesML running example - essentially the content of the SpesML website) is published under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC BY 4.0) license which allows distribution and modification of the material, even for commercial use. The name of the Gesellschat für Systems Engineering (GfSE) and/or the original authors must be mentioned and changes from the original must be indicated.
