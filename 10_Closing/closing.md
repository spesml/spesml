The closing event takes place on April 20th, 2023, at Siemens Healthcare in Erlangen and is open to the general public. During the event, the partners will present the results of the SpesML Project, which builds on a long history of research on the SPES Methodology and FOCUS theory. In a marketplace we will demonstrate selected results and give the opportunity for direct discussions with the project engineers. We welcome everybody interested in our research or further collaboration. For registration, please see the information below.
